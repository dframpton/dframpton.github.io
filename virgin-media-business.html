            <h1>Virgin Media Business</h1>

            <div class="intro">
                <p>I joined Virgin Media Business just over a year ago as the only designer, focusing on the portal for enterprise customers. Day-to-day I work directly alongside the developers, but also frequently interact with the business analyst, solution designer, and product owner.</p>
            </div>

            <p>My initial role was to produce high-fidelity prototypes and wireframes. Although on paper this is a very limited remit, there was the understanding that I would be able to work towards a more user-centred process as and when opportunities presented themselves to introduce design or research tasks.</p>

            <h2>Sketching and prototyping</h2>

            <p>An ongoing goal has been to get involved earlier in the process to make sure the voice of the user is represented. One of the ways I've tried to do this is by helping others to quickly visualise new functionality. I had seen the team get trapped in cyclical discussions when people struggle to understand requirements from something like a Word document.</p>
            <p>Depending on the desired outcome, a quick sketch, paper prototype, or flow mocked up in Axure, gives the conversation a common point of reference. Over time, this has meant that I've been included in earlier requirements-related meetings, where I've been able to explain the value of user research at this stage of a project.</p>

            <h2>Introducing research</h2>

            <p>During the first couple of months I looked for existing sources of customer feedback. The plan being to formalise whatever I could gather and present back to the business as a starting point for research. Although nothing is explicitly logged, I was still able to learn about the most commonly reported problems. Feeding these findings back to the team, plus results from a recently launched NPS survey, gave me the opportunity to propose and plan a first round of user research.</p>

            <p>Framing the sessions was a challenge, especially because they had to be arranged through internal account managers. I was trying to make sure we spent time with end users, at their desks, carrying out their usual day-to-day tasks. Unfortunately we only managed this with maybe a third of participants in the end. The other sessions ended up being discussions with team managers in meeting rooms.</p>

            <p>This has been a recurring theme, and I'm slowly trying to shift perceptions of user research from "asking users what they want" to "watching what users do". I now have a much better idea of how to articulate the importance of this, and am getting better at communicating to other team members and stakeholders who are (understandably) less familiar with research methods.</p>

            </figure>

            <p>As well as written notes, all sessions were recorded, which I transcribed in full. Although this was a time-consuming process, going through all the recordings in this way meant I became immersed in all the comments about the users' roles, problems and pain points, and tricks and workarounds.</p>

            <p>Once the transcriptions were complete, we ran an affinity sorting workshop with the product owner, lead developers, and business analyst. Although I was keen to share the experience of going out and spending time with our users, with the benefit of hindsight, it would have been better to have done more analysis before involving the rest of the team. Realistically, most of the team are only interested in actionable outcomes and what they can do with the insights.</p>

            <h2>Research outcomes</h2>

            <p>The product owner was keen to understand if there was a set of common user goals. Using the groupings from the affinity sorting, I tallied up similar comments into a slide deck of explicit goals, including the most relevant quotes to illustrate these.</p>

            <p>The other main outcome was a set of personas. After mapping behavioural variables I reviewed a rough first draft with the sales support team to make sure these matched with their experience. Following this I developed a final set and shared with the rest of the team and other stakeholders.</p>
