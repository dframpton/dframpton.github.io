            <h1>Kayak Search Listings</h1>

            <div class="intro">
                <p>I was asked to redesign the search results as a design exercise for an interview at cxpartners.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Usability testing</h2>

            <p>The first thing I wanted to do was to see how people could navigate the existing search results. Although not really usability testing, I wanted to capture first impressions and observations. A considerable challenge was avoiding too many leading questions.</p>

            <p>Feedback included:</p>
            <ul class="simple_list">
                <li>- Too much information at first glance.</li>
                <li>- Pairs of departure/return: not clear enough distinction?</li>
                <li>- Filters not a distraction, but in this case not even noticed. Conclusion?</li>
                <li>- Overall impression: “too small and cluttered”.</li>
                <li>- Price comparisons: redundancy? Prices displayed three times.</li>
            </ul>

            </figure>

            <p>I then did the same with hipmunk.com. I thought this would provide a good contrast as the display of data is quite different. Again, I asked them to think out loud and tried to lightly guide the conversation.</p>

            <ul class="simple_list">
                <li>- Visual representation of airline, departure/arrival times, and number of stops is clear and simple.</li>
                <li>- Is “agony” best default sort criteria?</li>
                <li>- Flight information on hover is a nice touch.</li>
                <li>- Absence of filters not noticed: too hypothetical a test?</li>
                <li>- Transition between departure and return not seen as a problem.</li>
                <li>- Clearer and easier to use than kayak.co.uk.</li>
            </ul>

            <figure>
                <style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='http://player.vimeo.com/video/84577272' frameborder='0' webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe></div>
                <p class="caption">First impressions of Hipmunk search listings</p>
            </figure>

            <p>I would have liked to better understand the browsing habits for a site like this. For example, Hipmunk appears to be simpler and more user friendly, but how easy is it to scan lots of results? Another big question is what are the priorities for users? Cost? Flight times? Duration? Knowledge of this would help when considering hierarchy.</p>

            <h2>Competitor Analysis</h2>

            <p>The following flight comparison sites were evaluated:</p>

            <ul class="simple_list">
                <li>www.britishairways.com</li>
                <li>www.expedia.co.uk</li>
                <li>www.hipmunk.com</li>
                <li>www.momondo.co.uk</li>
                <li>www.netflights.com</li>
                <li>www.seatguru.com</li>
                <li>www.skyscanner.com</li>
                <li>www.thetrainline.com</li>
                <li>www.travelsupermarket.com</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Sketching</h2>

            <p>Sketching was then used to investigate possibilities for improvement. Different attributes were worked on separately, but the overall focus was hierarchy and readability. The intention being to aid scanning large amounts of information quickly and efficiently.</p>

            </figure>

            <p>Looking back at where I got to in this time, I don’t feel I reached enough of a conclusion. I spent too much of the available time on research and not enough doing something with the findings. Limiting how long I spent on each activity would have allowed me to use the week I had more effectively.</p>

            <p>A better plan would have been:</p>
            <ul class="simple_list">
                <li>- 1 day on research.</li>
                <li>- 1 day on analysis.</li>
                <li>- 3 days on initial concepts, with iteration based on quick testing with users.</li>
                <li>- 2 days creating wireframes or a prototype.</li>
            </ul>
