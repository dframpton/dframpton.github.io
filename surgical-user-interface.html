            <h1>Surgical User Interface</h1>

            <div class="intro">
                <p>Greaves Best Design asked me to redesign the interface for a surgical product. It's used in operating theatres to remove tumours using the application of liquid nitrogen.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Brief</h2>

            <p>The key goal was to produce a more attractive interface in a couple of weeks. The motivation for this was to get FDA approval and buy-in from potential stakeholders. Unfortunately this meant there was no scope for research or usability testing.</p>

            <h2>Sketching</h2>

            <p>A storyboard was sketched out to think through the tasks involved. It also helped clarify the relationship between the hardware and software interactions.</p>

            </figure>

            <p>Initial sketching focused on exploring individual elements of the interface. This included ways of representing the size of the ice ball and the temperature of the probes. Alongside this were investigations into how to display the different channels of probe data.</p>

            </figure>

            <h2>Paper Prototypes</h2>

            <p>Sketches were made at 1:1 to get a feel for the screen size and how the different elements could be positioned. A significant priority was readability both from a distance and at a glance. This led to a layout where probe channels were displayed as vertical columns. Related data aligned in rows for easy left-to-right scanning.</p>

            </figure>

            <h2>Results</h2>

            <p>The final outcome for this stage of the project was static layouts for each screen. Within the constraints of the limited scope the project was successful. It was completed on time and on budget. Although subjective and not measurable, the client was very happy with the deliverables.</p>

            <h2>Looking back</h2>

            <p>Looking back at this project three years later, the lack of research is an even bigger issue for me. So many design decisions would have been informed by what we would have learnt. Spending time with the surgeons and nurses would have been invaluable. Without this it was just a styling exercise.</p>

            <p>From a personal perspective I would have loved to have been able to do this research. I've come to realise that I really enjoy this exploratory part of the process. Spending time with users and then making sense of the data is extremely interesting and rewarding. I'm keen to do a lot more of this and further develop my skills.</p>
